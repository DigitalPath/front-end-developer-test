# String Transformer

This program needs to transform a string according to the following pattern but it contains some errors:
* `G` -> `C`
* `C` -> `G`
* `T` -> `A`
* `A` -> `U`

Once the output is as described in the test cases below, the challenge is complete. :-)

## Test Cases

#### Case 1
Input: 'G'  
Output: 'C'

#### Case 2
Input: 'TAGC'  
Output: 'AUCG'

#### Case 3
Input: 'ACGTGGTCTTAA'  
Output: 'UGCACCAGAAUU'
